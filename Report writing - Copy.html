<p><strong>Guidelines for writing reports</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>When writing your report keep in mind the following points:</p>
<p>1. Your report should be self-contained. The reader should be able to understand the whole story&nbsp;without looking into your code, reading instructions, or checking other papers.</p>
<p>2. Your report should be well structured. For each task explain what you were supposed to do, what you actually did, what are the results and, most importantly, draw some conclusions.</p>
<p>3. Your report should be detailed. When explaining your experiments, specify the setup (values of parameters you used, algorithms, options, etc.), so the reader could get a fair picture of what you did, without checking your code. Your report should contain observations and conclusions that you’ve made while working on the assignment. In case you see something strange in your results, write something about it! Most importantly: try to explain possible reasons for the strange things you've observed!</p>
<p>4. Your report should be technically correct. Make sure that your report is neatly formatted, spellchecked,&nbsp;tables and figures contain informative captions.</p>

<p><strong>Review&nbsp;</strong><strong>criteria</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>When evaluating the reports,&nbsp;we&nbsp;will take&nbsp;into account the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Clarity and Readability:</strong> can you easily follow the story and understand what the authors</p>
<p>wanted to communicate?</p>
<p>2. <strong>Completeness:</strong> are all tasks that were listed in the assignment fully addressed?</p>
<p>3. <strong>Validity:</strong> do you believe that the results are valid? Are they consistent with your expectations?</p>
<p>4. <strong>Reflection:</strong> are the observations and conclusions made in the paper properly supported by experiments? Are some interesting, unexpected insights presented?</p>
<p>Have you learned something new when reading the report?&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. <strong>Technical correctness:</strong> is the report neatly formatted spell-checked, tables and figures contain&nbsp;informative captions, etc.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Contributions of group members:</strong></p>
<p>In order to encourage an even distribution of workload throughout the assignments between group members, we would like you to include a short section on individual contributions in each of your reports. This should look something like:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Contributions:</em></span><br><em>Bob: Task 1 code, task 1 report, task 2 code</em><br><em>Jane: Task 2 code, task 3 code</em><br><em>John: Task 2 report, task 3 code, task 3 report</em><em></em></p>
<p>In the vast majority of cases, this will not influence your grades in any way. This measure is mostly for handling the very rare cases where some group members refuse to contribute completely and then these statements might be used as proof to adjust the grades (assuming the claims are valid).</p>
